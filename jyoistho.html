                <p>Jyeshtha or Jyēṣṭha  is a month of the Hindu calendar. In India's national civil calendar, Jyestha is the third month of the year. Known as Joishtho in Bengali, it is the second month of the Bengali calendar.
 In lunar religious calendars, Jyēṣṭha begins on the new moon and is the third month of the year.Traditionally, Jyēṣṭha is associated with high summer, and corresponds to May–June[2] in the Gregorian calendar. In Tamil, the month is known as Āni, the third month of the solar calendar that begins in mid-June</p>
                <p>Nirjala Ekadashi is celebrated on Shukla Paksha (waxing moon) Ekadashi (11th day) of Jyeshtha. It is the most sacred and auspicious Ekadashis among all 24 Ekadashis in a year. One can attain the benefits of all 24 Ekadashis by fasting on this day.</p>
                <p>Snana Yatra is a bathing festival celebrated on the Purnima (full moon day) of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. It is an important festival of the Jagannath Cult. The deities Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra, Sudarshan, and Madanmohan are brought out from the Jagannath Temple (Puri) and taken in a procession to the Snana Bedi. They are ceremonially bathed and decorated for a public audience</p>
